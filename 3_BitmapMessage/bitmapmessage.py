"""
This program uses a multiline string as a 
bitmap, a 2D image with only two possible 
colors for each pixel, to determine how it 
should display a message from the user. In this 
bitmap, space characters represent an empty space, 
and all other characters are replaced by characters in 
the userâ€™s message. The provided bitmap resembles 
a world map, but you can change this to any image 
youâ€™d like. The binary simplicity of the space-or-message-characters system makes it good for beginners. 
Try experimenting with different messages to 
see what the results look like!
